What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge preserves the branch history and combines two branches back into one, often resulting in merge conflicts.
Merges are useful when collaborating with others.

Rebasing keeps the git history linear, as it changes the start of a branch to the latest node on the main.
This makes it easier to understand because there are less branches, but it can also cause confusion for coworkers.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a codebase that exists virtually, often on a server.
Many remote repositories are hosted by services such as github and gitlab.
